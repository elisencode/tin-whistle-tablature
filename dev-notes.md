There are three branches for this plugin in the code [repository][repo]:

* MuseScore 2.x is on branch 'version2'
* MuseScore 3.x is on branch 'version3'
* the 'main' branch is for MuseScore 4.x

Note that the instrument ID changed for version 4.0.x and then changed back again for 4.1

### test

* Load the plugin and makes sure the Plugin Manager can enable/disable it
* MuseScore 4.x onwards removed the Plugin Creator tool,
    so if you want console logs then run MuseScore itself from command line
* Apply tabs to the range test examples, all staves should have the same tabs:
  * whistle range test: `examples/tin_whistle_range_test.mscz`
  * low whistle range test: `examples/low_whistle_range_test.mscz`

### release

There are _two_ release areas, MuseScore community and also github repo release
